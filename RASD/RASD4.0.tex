\subsection{Purpose}%PURPOSE
This is the first of a series of documents aimed to project a digital management system for a car sharing service. Identifying stakeholders, modeling scenarios and formalizing requirements and constrains of the system are the main topics of this document.

\subsection{Descriprtion of the given problem}%DESCRIPTION OF THE GIVEN PROBLEM
We are going to design a digital management system for a car sharing service that only employs electric cars (i.e. cars powered by rechargeable batteries), which are environment-friendly and noise-free.?Precisely, we want to offer the possibility to users to choose a car among an amount of cars dislocated into Milan's urban area, to travel across the city.?Electric cars gather their fuel when they are plugged into proper power grids; these grids are placed all around the city: they can be found into specific charging stations, beyond near a decent number of parking lots around Milan.?Cars can be parked everywhere inside Milan urban area (i.e. any kind of appropriate car park, accordingly to Italian laws, including pay and display parking lots). ?Operators are available to make sure that cars are never left with less than 20\% battery charge by charging them into near charging stations or in place.?The final aim of the system is to provide a service within anyone's reach, that stands for a solid alternative to public transport.
\subsection{Stakeholders} %STAKEHOLDERS
The only stakeholders that we have is Power\&Joy society that require the management system of car sharing.
\subsection{Glossary}%GLOSSARY
\begin{itemize} 
\item \textbf{System:} is the system we will create which is going to manage the car sharing service. The system has a dedicated database where it can store and access all needed information.
\item \textbf{User :} every person registered into the system that wants to use a car.
\item \textbf{Not Register User (NRU) :} all people not registered in the system.
\item \textbf{Operators:}  employees working on charging stations whose job is recharge every car that has less 20% battery level and to provide assistance to the users.
\item \textbf{Passenger :} a person who is traveling in a car (included the driver). 
\item \textbf{Registration (for Users): } consists in the act of inserting all the needed information into the system as
\begin {itemize}
\item First name and Last name
\item E-mail
\item Password
\item Phone number
\item Birth date 
\item ID card code 
\item Drive license code


\item Credit card number 
\item Fiscal code
\end{itemize}



\item \textbf{ Safe Area: } Milan?s urban centre.
\item  \textbf{Power grid station:} a stopping place for electric cars equipped with electric socket and where operators work.
\item \textbf{Available car:} is a car that is not currently used by other users and has the battery charge level over 20%.
\item \textbf{Parking lot:} every available car park inside the Safe Area that respects the Italian traffic laws.
\item  \textbf{Special Parking lot:} every parking lot equipped with electric socket.
\item  \textbf{Safe Zone: }is a circular zone with 3 km of diameter which centre is a power grid station.
\item  \textbf{Reservation:} is the ability to reserve a car for at maximum 1 hour, then the reservation expires.
\item  \textbf{Contactless  card: }card acquired by users at the moment of the registration used to unlock the reserved cars.
\item  \textbf{Special contactless card:} Magnetic card acquired by operators at the moment of the registration that can be used to unlock any car.
\item  \textbf{Unlock Car:}  to undo the lock of car?s doors  by  placing the contactless cards or special contactless cards near specific sensors placed over the car doors.
\item  \textbf{Password: }is the key to log in to the system.
\item  \textbf{Status (of a car):} any of the possible conditions of the cars (low  charge/assistance needed/accident/no issues). 
\item  \textbf{Reserved Operator area:} special section of the system where operators can register and log in, and from which they can access information about the position and the status of all the cars.
\item  \textbf{Ride: }it starts one minute after the user unlocks the car and ends when the user shuts down the car and pushes on the display ?end the ride? button.
\item  \textbf{Pit Stop:} it happen when the user stops the car for a short period of time (maximum 60 minutes) and keep  the car reserved in order to continue the ride.
\item  \textbf{End the ride:} user stops the car, leaving it in a safe parking lot so that the car is made available for other reservations by other users.
\item  \textbf{Scalability: }is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged in order to accommodate that growth.
\item  \textbf{Quality of Service:}  is the overall performance of a computer network, particularly the performance seen by the users of the network. His attributes are: Performance, Reliability, Scalability, Capacity, Accuracy, Availability, Robustness, Integrity and Confidentiality.
\item  \textbf{On-board computer:} a computer equipped with a touch screen and a GPS navigation device, placed in every car. It can also perform calls (in particular, it can perform accident calls, as defined below).
\item  \textbf{CID module: }a document that must be filled in case of accident by the people involved with the accident details (according to Italian traffic laws)
\item  \textbf{Assistance call: }call made by an user from his phone to ask for assistance about how to use the cars. These calls are picked up by the call center
\item  \textbf{Call center:}  place where assistance calls are picked up by operators. The only  job of the operators who work on the call center is to pick up assistance call (they do not provide physical assistance to users). Call center is NOT equipped with power grids.
\item  \textbf{Accident calls:} calls automatically started by the on-board computer when a user taps on the ''REPORT ACCIDENT'' button on the on-board computer. 
\item  \textbf{Card ID:} a number associated to each operator (written on their contactless card) that identifies them

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reference documents} %REFERENCE DOCUMENTS
These are the documents we used as guideline:
\begin{itemize}
\item Specification Document: Assignment AA 2016-2017 (RASD)
\item IEEE Std 830-1998 IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications.
\item Examples Documents: RASD sample from Oct. 20 lecture.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Overview} %OVERVIEW
After a short description of the system?s properties, we define goals (e.g. the functions the system has to be able to perform)  and constrains, and make assumptions that we suppose hold in the analyzed world. Then we analyze and formalize the goals with the help of UML diagrams (use case, sequence diagrams, class diagram) and the formal language Alloy. 

\section{Overall Description} %OVERALL DESCRIPTION
\subsection{Product Perspective} %PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE
We want this service to be accessible via mobile or web app. Every user (i.e. person who wants to reserve and ride a car)  must register to the system via the mobile or web app providing general information (full name, age, e-mail etc.) and specific ID's (fiscal code, drive license code). Once registered and logged in,  the system allows user to view on a map the current geographical position of every available car, thanks to GPS sensors on each car. Cars already in use by other users do not display, but the system can access the information about the positions and the batteries of every single car, weather they are being used or not, any time it needs to (in case of assistance requests et al.).\\??Users can choose a car at the time, and make a reservation for it. They shall reach the car within 60 minutes from the moment the reservation is made,  to be able to use the car.?When near, users can unlock the car by simply placing  their contactless card  (provided at the moment of the registration) near the sensor placed on the car door.?The system unlocks the car soon after and the user is able to get in. In order to start the ride, the user simply needs to turn the key  placed inside the car. 
Every car is equipped with an on-board computer, that can be used to communicate the existence of damages over the car as well as GPS navigator device.?Before starting the ride, the system encourages the user to make sure the car is not damaged or compromised, and to communicate it, in case issues are found, via the mobile app or the on-board computer.
Once the car is started, the user starts to be charged per minute of ride.\\?Once they end the ride, users can park cars in every available car park inside the urban area (which includes any kind of parking lot, accordingly to Italian laws, pay and display car parks included, private parking lots excluded).  ?Some special parking lots are equipped with power grids to recharge the car, and discounts are available in case users take care to plug the car in.?Discounts are also available in case the user leaves the car with more than 50\% battery charge or if he takes on the ride 2 more passengers , while the user is going to pay 30\% more of the price of his ride in case he leaves the car with 20\% battery charge or more than 3 km away from the nearest charging station.\\?Payments are always carried out through the credit card that the user has to insert at the moment of the registration and a receipt is available to view with the mobile app or via e-mail.
A group of operators is available to give assistance to users and to make sure cars are never left under 20\% battery charge. Operators work at charging stations and can access all the information about cars positions and batteries. \\

\subsection{Actors Identifying} %ACTORS IDENTIFYING
There are two main kind of people the System needs to interact with:
\begin {itemize}
\item Users
\item Oprators

\end {itemize}
Both of them need to be registered into the system.?Operators work at the charging stations and need to pick up and recharge every car below 20% battery charge and provide assistance to users, if needed.?The goals concerning  the interaction between these two groups of people and the system are described below.

\item User only pay for damages found on the cars if they actually performed those damages
\item Accident calls are picked up by operators who do not work on the call center (only charging stations)
\item Operators have a special contact-less card they can use to unlock the cars, acquired at the moment of the registration into the system
\item Operators can drive any car unlocking them via the special contact-less card, and without  paying for the ride
\item In case of accident the user always takes care of stopping the car in some place where it doesn?t create problems to the traffic flow, never panics, fills the CID modules (according to Italian laws)  and remains in the place where the accident happened until the arrive of the operator
\item In case users leave any kind of items into the cars after ending the ride, they can inform operators about that via a phone call, and operators will pick their stuff; users will collect it in one of the charging station

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Constrains} %CONSTRAINS
\begin{itemize}
\item The implementation language must be Java
\item The credit card payment system must be able to be dynamically invoked by other systems relying on it

Power\&Joy webApp needs internet connection for working. In particular if a user needs to make a reservation or cancel it , he has to switch on 3G  or LAN wireless connection. \\

\flushleft{ \textbf{Concurrent operations}}\\
The system has to guarantee multiple processes from different connected users.\\
\flushleft{ \textbf{Hardware limitations}}\\
All the mobile phone must have GPS to localize and reach the cars. They required a space for App package too.\\

We are thinking about extending  the perimeter of the safe area to the whole region, and possibly applying it to other regions.  We also plan to implement a more innovative and computationally efficient method to let the system check whether a car is parked within 3 km of distance from the nearest safe area , using a special signal created by emitters  placed into charging stations instead of  using the GPS sensor.
