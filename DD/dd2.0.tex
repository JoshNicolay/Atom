  \section{Introduction}


\subsection{Purpose}%1.1) PURPOSE

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed functional description of the Power{ampersand}Joy car sharing management system. It is aimed at developers, and contains all the information about the architectural and design choices made, which include design patterns, the identification of the main components and the interaction among them, and the system's Runtime behavior.   
  
\subsection{Scope} %1.2) SCOPE
The management system for the  Power{ampersand}Joy electric car sharing service has two different targets of people: users and operators. 
Both of them can register and log into the system via mobile or web app (the registration and login are different for users and operators, but they are accessible via the same web AND mobile app). 
The system allows users to view on a map the position of all the available cars placed inside the safe area, to search for cars  near a specific area, reserve a car and ride it (a user can only ride a car he reserved, and only if he manages to unlock it within an hour by the moment the reservation was made). In case a car has some kind of issues users can communicate it to the system via an on-board computer placed inside every car. The system allows users to make a pit-stop of maximum 60 minutes. In case of accident, users can report it to an operator starting a call from the on-board computer, in order to receive assistance.
The system allows operators to view a list of all the cars, providing their current position , battery charge, and status. The status of a car tells weather it is functional or not, and in the latter case, describes the kind of issues (accident/lowBattery/AssistanceNeeded) affecting that car. Operators' job is to resolve any kind of issue on those cars that need it and provide assistance to users involved in accidents. Operators can inform the system they are taking care of an issued car clicking on a button available on the row of the list associated to an issued car. The system manages to allow only a single operator to take care of a specific car, by hiding the corresponding button to all operators once an operator pressed it, and informing everyone about which cars are already being taken care of. An operator who took care of a car, can inform the system that he has finished his job clicking on a dedicated button on the same list. Cars with no issues are listed as well.

\subsection{Definitiona, acronyms} %1.3) DEFINITIONS
\begin {itemize}
\item SYSTEM: is the system we will create which is going to manage the car sharing service. The system has a dedicated database where it can store and access all needed information.

\section{Architecture Design}  %2)ARCHITECTURE DESING
\subsection{Overview}  %2.1) OVERVIEW
The Power\&Joy has a three tier architecture.

\textbf{Mapping between layers and tiers}
\begin{description}
\item PRESENTATION TIER: consists on the web browser, the mobile app and the on-board computers of the cars. These are light clients, which only correspond to the presentation layers. The web browser and mobile app communicate to the web server, sending HTTP/S requests and receiving the HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT responses;  they need to get through a firewall in order to enhance security. The on-board computers directly communicate with the application server, since the security is already granted by the card ID recognition, at the moment when the car is unlocked.
\item APPLICATION TIER: consists on a web server and an application server; the web server (Apache HTTP server) processes the HTTP/S requests coming from the clients, elaborates the web pages and generates dynamic contents. The application server contains all the business logics. it receives it's inputs from the web server and the onboard computers, and does all the needed computation in order to generate the dynamic pages and  provide them 
to the clients. It can communicate to the Oracle database. There is a firewall between the web server and the application server.
\item DATA TIER:  it consists on the database, which contains all the needed information about users, cars, reservations, operators et al. , which can be accessed by the application server via sql queries.


\end{description}







\subsection{Component View}  %2.2) COMPONENTS
\subsubsection{High level component view} %2.2.1) HL COMPONENTS
The figure below shows the main high level components of the application and the interaction among them.
\vspace{1.5cm}


\includegraphics[width=15cm, height=10cm]{HLComponent} 


\vspace{1.5cm}
The nexus is where the core of the application is allocated, which contains all the business logics. It needs to communicate with several other components as follows.




\begin {itemize}
\item The User can establish a connection with the nexus via the mobile app and web browser logging in and requesting the information about the cars he can reserve. This is a synchronous communication, since the user needs to wait the response from the nexus, before going on asking for a car reservation, etc. 
\item The operators can establish an synchronous communication with the nexus in order to take care of cars: they can request to the nexus the list of cars and their information logging in, and, once the nexus provided it to them, they can choose a car to take care of and click on the "Operate" button associate to that car, so that the nexus can update the list, and the same when the issue is resolved.

\item The on-board computer of the cars has an asynchronous communication with the nexus, in order to provide updated information about the status of all the cars.
\item The on-board computer also needs to establish a synchronous communication with the nexus  when users want to unlock the cars they reserved, start and end their ride.
\item The nexus also needs to store and access all the information about users, operators, rides, cars positions and status on the database.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Component View}
 %2.2.3)COMPONENT VIEW
 
\vspace{0.5cm}

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{component} 

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin {itemize}
\item Reservation Controller: manages reservation requests
\item Issues Manager:  supervises  and updates car statuses in case issues occur during a ride
\item Operator Controller: manages operators information and activities
\item User Controller: manages users information 
\item Discounts\&Penalties Manager : computes the final price of the rides  taking into account the information acquired from the on-board computer and the discounts and penalties rules
\item PitStop Manager : manages the duration and fees of the pitstops during the rides 
\item RideManager : manages all the ride information
\item PaymentManager : extracts the information about the rides and the users (credit card number and final price) and sends them to the payment system
\item Connection Controller: dispatches the incoming requests to the appropriate Controller, which will then do the needed work as described above

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Deployment View}  %2.3) DEPLOYMENT
\vspace{4cm}

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{deployment} 





\subsection{Runtime View} %2.4) RUNTIME
%SEQUENCE

\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{seq1_login} 
\newpage
\textbf{Sequence Diagram 1: Operator Login}
\break
The above diagram shows how an operator can log into the system. In order to do that, he has to be registered first. The operator accesses the login page from his mobile app and inputs his credentials (a username and a password). The mobile app transfers this request to the operator controller, that checks that there is a tuple corresponding to that operator into the database. If there is one, than the operator controller sets the answer to ''true'' only if the password that the operator inserted matches with the one saved on the tuple. The mobile app receives the answer and shows the operator home page only if the answer is true. Otherwise it shows an instance of error1 (inserted credentials not valid). \\
The router that appears as an actor sums up the actual device which takes care to send the request through the network to the application server and the connection controller, that receives the request and pushes it to the right controller component in the application.\\
The logging via the web browser is analogous to the one via mobile app.\\
Log in for the users involves the same operations, with the User Controller instead of the Operator one.



\newpage
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{seq2_reservation} 
\newpage
\textbf{Sequence Diagram 2: User reserves a car}
\break
The above diagram shows the actions performed in order to let a user reserve a car. \\
The user has to be registered and have successfully inserted his credentials to log in. Once he submits them (assuming they have been already checked as valid) , the mobile app sends a request to show the map to localize the cars. This request arrives to the Reservation Controller, that first needs to check if the user has already an ongoing reservation or ride. It interrogates the database, and sets the answer to a value that distinguishes the following three cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A valid reservation tuple (which means one associated to a reservation which is not expired yet) associated to the user is found; Then answer is set to ''1'', and the user is redirected to the reservation page corresponding to the reservation he already performed
\item A ride tuple associated to the user is found: this means that the user is already performing a ride; Then the answer is set to ''-1'' and an instance of error2 (already on a ride) is showed and the user is not redirected anywhere.
\item Neither a valid reservation or ride associated to the user is found; Then the answer is set to 0, and the mobile app shows the map with the cars . 
\end{enumerate} 
The third case is further exploited, in order to show how a user can actually reserve a car; he selects a car, and the app shows the reservation button; the user taps on that button and a request of a new reservation is sent to the reservation controller, which creates a new instance of reservation and updates the database. The user is then redirected to the reservation page, where he can see all the reservation details such as the carID, the timer, the car position ecc.


\newpage
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq3_start_ride} 
\newpage
\textbf{Sequence Diagram 3: User starts a ride}
\break
We already said back in RASD how the car should be provided with an appropriate system of its own, which means it has to be equipped with all the needed sensors and actuators communicating with the on-board computer, which can send requests to the application server in order to perform all the operations to let the user ride the car.\\
The above diagram describes the start of the ride, which is requested by the user by placing its contact-less card on the door sensor. Then a request is sent to the Ride controller, that checks that the user has a valid on-going reservation. The answer is set to ''true''only if a valid tuple is found and the carID on the reservation tuple matcher the one of the car that the user is trying to unlock. If that happens, the doors are unlocked, otherwise, a red light is shown and the doors remain locked.
If the user manages to correctly unlock the car and starting the ride tapping on the ''START RIDE'' button on the on-board computer, then the ride controller updates the database removing the reservation tuple and adding a ride one, and creates a new instance of ride. Once these operations are correctly performed, the on-board computer starts the timer, to store the information about the ride length, which is then sent to the application server (once the ride is terminated, which is not shown in the diagram) to perform the payment 

\newpage
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{seq4_accident} 
\newpage
\textbf{Sequence Diagram 4: Accident|}
\break
The above diagram shows the actions performed in case an accident occurs. It is signaled by the user tapping a dedicated button on the on-board computer. It then sends a request to the ride controller, which terminates the ride. It stops charging the user and deletes the ride tuple on the database, but saves locally the information about the ride itself in order to lately perform the payment. It also sends a request to the issue manager, which creates an instance of accident and updates the car status on the database, in order to let all the operators know about what happened. Once all these operations have been correctly performed, the onboard computer makes a call to an operator, which acquires the accident details from the user. Once he is satisfied, he accesses its home page (logging in as described in Sequence Diagram 1) requesting the updated list to the operator controller, and looks for the row on the list corresponding to the car involved in the accident. He then taps on the ''OPERATE'' button, and the mobile app creates an instance of operation and sends a request to the operator controller in order to update the car statuses informing all other operators that that issue is already being taken care of. Once the operator provided assistance to the user, he informs the operator controller tapping on the ''ISSUE SOLVED'' button. The operator controller updates the car tuple once again and informs the issue manager that the issue has been solved. The issue manager deletes the accident instance, and the operator mobile app deletes the operation instance.

\subsection{Component Interfaces} %2.5) INTERFACES

\subsection{Selected Architectural Styles and Patterns} %2.6) SSASP 
\subsubsection{Overall Architecture}
Our application will be divided into 3 tiers:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Presentation tier (thin clients )
\item Application tier (contains all the business logic)
\item Data tier (database to store all information)
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Protocols}
Our tiers are connected through network and exchange data with the following protocols.
\vspace{1cm}
\\

\textbf{PHP}(Hypertext Preprocessor) : used to generate dynamic web pages\break\break

\textbf{PDO}(PHP Data Objects): used by the Business logics to communicate with the Data layer. \break\break

\textbf{HTTPS} (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer): application layer protocol used for sharing information in a safe way across the World Wide Web . It's a typical protocol used in a client-server architecture\break\break

\textbf{TCP/IP}(Internet Protocol Suite) : provides and-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed and received.\break\break

\textbf{SSL}(Secure Socket Layer): cryptographic protocol used to provide communication security over a computer network. Its aim is to provide privacy and data integrity between two communicating computer applications\break\break

\textbf{JDBC}(Java DataBase Connectivity): application programming interface (API) for the programming language Java, which defines how a client may access a database. It provides methods to query and update data in a database, and is oriented towards relational databases \break\break

\textbf{Trusty TEE}(Trusted Excecution Environment) that consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item An operating system (the Trusty OS) that runs on a processor intended to provide a TEE
\item Drivers for the Android kernel (Linux) to facilitate communication with applications running under the Trusty OS
\item A set of libraries for Android systems software to facilitate communication with trusted applications executed within the Trusty OS using the kernel drivers

\end{itemize} 
\vspace{1cm}



\subsubsection{Design Patterns}

\textbf{MVC}(Model View Controller) comes in the form of the Laravel PHP framework as well as the internal component structure of the software components running on the application server\\
\textbf{Client-Server}  is used to partition the tasks between the provider of the service (server) and the service requesters (web browser and mobile application used by users and operators and the on-board computer). This is useful because of its centralized structure that allows us to have thin client , for accessibility of the resources remotely allocated, and security  thanks to access rights to the data, which is all stored in the same place


\subsection{Other Design Decisions} %2.7) ODD
We also decided to integrate our web application and our mobile applications with a map service.
